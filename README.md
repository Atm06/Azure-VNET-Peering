# Azure-VNET-Peering

VNet peering (or Virtual Network peering) enables you to connect virtual networks. 
A VNet peering connection between virtual networks enables you to route traffic between them privately through IPv4 addresses. 
Virtual machines in the peered VNets can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
